# MMM-ShoppingList
Shopping List Module for MagicMirrorÂ² that utilizes MMM-GoogleAssistant to add and remove items to a list. 

# Description
This module uses voice commands to add items to a shopping list, organizing each item as a bullet point on your mirror. It's designed to help you add food items to the list as you finish them in the kitchen. You can then download the list as a PDF via the local web server and view it while shopping in the store.

Once you've returned home from the grocery store, you can ask the mirror to clear the shopping list and start fresh for the new week.
