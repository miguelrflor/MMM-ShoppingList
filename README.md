# MMM-ShoppingList
Shopping List Module for MagicMirrorÂ² that utilizes MMM-GoogleAssistant to add and remove items to a list. 

# Description
This module uses voice commands to add items to a shopping list, organizing each item as a bullet point on your mirror. It's designed to help you add food items to the list as you finish them in the kitchen. You can then download the list as a PDF to your phone via the local web server and view it while shopping in the store.

Once you've returned home from the grocery store, you can ask the mirror to clear the shopping list and start fresh for the new week. 

# How it Works

The Shopping List module can be started by triggering your Google Assistant using its listener ("Hey Google", "Ok Google", "Jarvis", etc).  

Followed by either of the three below commands:

    1.) "Add <item> to the shopping list"
  
    2.) "Remove <item> from the shopping list"
  
    3.) "Clear the shopping list"

The commands are self-explanatory, but please note that the first two are meant to handle only one item at a time. The module will write to a JSON file (shoppingList.json) and store each item in a string array. This module utilizes a local HTTP web server using Node.js. 

The server uses port 3000, so if your Raspberry PI has a local address of 127.0.0.1, you would access the list at 127.0.0.1:3000. Or you can just open a web browser and type "http://localhost:3000/". 

The server can be launched manually by going to ~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-ShoppingList/WebServer and typing node WebServer.js in the terminal. You should see the following message **Server running at http://localhost:3000/
